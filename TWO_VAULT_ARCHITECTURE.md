**There is only ONE Portal.**

**The Portal opens when:**
1. ✅ Gate Vault opens (Emerald Key)

3. ✅ Identity validates (Covenant Seal Key)

**The Portal is:**
- **Location:** bridgeworld.lol
- **Status:** Ready to open
- **Trigger:** Gate Vault opening (Emerald Key claim)
- **Result:** Public Archivist domain becomes visible

The map shows:

- ✅ **One Vault on the River** (Gate Vault — main path)
- ✅ **Only one key drawn on the map** (Emerald Key — visible)
- ✅ **Two vault gates drawn** (mountain + river)

**This matches the architecture perfectly.**
