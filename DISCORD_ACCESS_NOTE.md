# 🔍 Discord Access Note

## ⚠️ **Issue**

Discord requires authentication to view channel messages. The browser automation script can access the Discord page, but it shows a login screen instead of messages.

## 💡 **Solution Options**

### Option 1: Manual Copy/Paste (Recommended)
Please copy/paste the relevant information from the Discord channel:
- Fix/workaround for x402 Solana dependency issue
- Package versions or commands
- Code snippets or configuration

### Option 2: Use Browser with Your Session
If you're logged into Discord in Brave Browser, I can try to:
1. Use your existing browser profile
2. Access the channel with your session
3. Extract the messages

### Option 3: Discord Bot Token
If you have a Discord bot token with access to that channel, I can use the Discord API directly.
